# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is a mock up of a website with all elements displayed correctly on some popular screen sizes. The opacity of the various buttons across the webpage change opacity when you hover over them. The purpose of this is to make a website adaptive and be able to display correctly on various devices' screen sizes. Some techniques used to make this include Flexbox and grid properties. Most of this project uses standard CSS and HTML.

  **Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
