### Overview

**Intro**

This project is a mock up of a website with all elements displayed correctly on some popular screen sizes. The opacity of the various buttons across the webpage change opacity when you hover over them. The purpose of this is to make a website adaptive and be able to display correctly on various devices' screen sizes.
